# Containerized locust testing client for redcap deployment on kubernetes

This application's intent is to load test the current redcap deployment on kubernetes. 

These series of scripts will call the public survey url endpoint generated by specific projects, bypassing SSO.

The following methods are tested at scale
- Rendering public survey within a given response time
- Submitting a survey



## Setup
 Please create a .env file with the following configuration and place it in root.

```
    public_survey_url=""
    multiple_public_survey_url1=""
    multiple_public_survey_url2=""
    multiple_public_survey_url3=""
    multiple_public_survey_url4=""
```

## Running tests

Simply run `docker-compose build` followed by `docker-compose up` to start the container.

Navigate to `http://localhost:8089/` to begin using the locus testing suite.

Default configuration gives both classes a weight of 1, please ensure you specify at least 2 for the number of users.
